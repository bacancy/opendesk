;; This is a sample app.ini file.  Your application will dictate the format and the
;; type of sections and data that can be found in this ini file.  It will also dictate
;; how many ini files will be contained in your config/ directory.  For the puropose
;; of our application, this one file makes the most sense.

;; we always have our "production" section first, because it will define ALL of the
;; keys that our application is expecting to see.

;; this is important so that we can make the most self-contained, and modular application we
